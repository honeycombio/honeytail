`honeytail` is [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io)'s agent for ingesting log file data into Honeycomb and making it available for exploration. Its favorite format is **JSON**, but understands how to parse a range of other well-known log formats.

See [our documentation](https://honeycomb.io/docs/send-data/agent/) to read about how to configure and run `honeytail`, to find tips and best practices, and to download prebuilt versions.

## Supported Parsers

`honeytail` supports reading files from `STDIN` as well as from a file on disk.

Our complete list of parsers can be found in the [`parsers/` directory](parsers/), but as of this writing, `honeytail` will support parsing logs generated by:

- [ArangoDB](parsers/arangodb/)
- [MongoDB](parsers/mongodb/)
- [MySQL](parsers/mysql/)
- [PostgreSQL](parsers/postgresql/) (Note: does not support quoted table or column names in queries.)
- [nginx](parsers/nginx/)
- [regex](parsers/regex/)
- [keyval](parsers/keyval/)([logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt))
- [csv](parsers/csv/)
- [syslog](parsers/syslog/)

## Installation

Install from source:

```
go install github.com/honeycombio/honeytail@latest
```

to install to a specific path:

```
GOPATH=/usr/local go install github.com/honeycombio/honeytail@latest
```

the binary will install to `/usr/local/bin/honeytail`

Use a prebuilt binary: find the latest version on [Honeycomb.io](https://honeycomb.io/docs/send-data/agent/)

## Usage

Using command line arguments:

```shell
honeytail --writekey=YOUR_WRITE_KEY --dataset='Best Data Ever' --parser=json --file=/var/log/api_server.log
```

Using a config file:

```shell
honeytail --config honeytail-conf.ini
```
